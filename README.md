GNU Mailman integration with Wordpress based on the GNU Mailman Plugin by Ryan Gure (http://blog.ryan.gy/applications/wordpress/gnu-mailman/)

Integrate GNU Mailman into your Wordpress website.  This script allows administrators to add multiple mailman mailing lists for users to subscribe to.  Users can subscribe or unsubscribe to any of the mailing lists through their user profile.
The administration of subscriptions is also possible via WordPress Groups (https://wordpress.org/plugins/groups/) capabilities.
